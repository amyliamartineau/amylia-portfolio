## Quick Start

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site. The page loads Bootstrap from a CDN, so no build step is required.

## Features

- Dark/light theme toggle
- Responsive navigation bar and sections
- Example project card and certification gallery

Feel free to customize the content and styles to suit your needs.
